      <h4>Description</h4>
      <p>
        The Gates of Hell is a monumental sculptural work by French artist
        Auguste Rodin, created between 1880 and 1917. It depicts scenes from
        Dante Alighieri's Inferno, symbolizing the torments of the damned and
        the chaos of the underworld. The sculpture features intricate details
        and a dramatic composition, showcasing writhing bodies and contorted
        expressions conveying agony and despair. The central figures include
        “The Thinker” Thinker and “The Kiss,” which were later incorporated into
        the design. Standing over 20 feet tall and weighing several tons, the
        gates represent a powerful representation of the concept of the Gates of
        Hell in art. This is the first ever officially licensed The Gates of
        Hell NFT as a premium digital artwork in 3D by ElmonX.
